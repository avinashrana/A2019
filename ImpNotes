gradlew.bat clean build shadowJar

Error: If you are getting errro -> ERROR: JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.11\bin

then go to gradlew.bat file -> 
:findJavaFromJavaHome
set JAVA_HOME=%JAVA_HOME:"=%
set JAVA_EXE=%JAVA_HOME%/bin/java.exe

The error is that it is appedning the extra path in our java JDK path and if we echo %JAVA_HOME% then
we ll found out that it is priniting C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.11\bin/bin/java.exe

So the resolution is ->
set JAVA_EXE=%JAVA_HOME%\java.exe
